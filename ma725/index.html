<h4> Course materials </h4>

In addition to the text of Lu, I will post some standalone notes here as they become relevant.
I will also try to post my handwritten lecture notes from each class (see course log).

<br>
<br>

Additionally, while we only have one official textbook, the following list of references below are excellent (albeit cover very different topics). 
Sometimes, these topics may align with the topics of the course, so that is why I am listing them here.

      <li> <a href= "https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.952/2018SP/files/18.952_book.pdf"> Differential forms </a>. These are notes from a class taught by Victor Guillemin at MIT. Notes written by Peter J. Haine. 
      <li> <a href= "https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/dafr/bordism.pdf"> Notes on bordism </a>, by Dan Freed. Great source for background on bundles, principal bundles, and characteristic classes.
