  </summary>
  <p>
    We develop the algebraic underpinnings for local operators in a partially holomorphic, partially topological three-dimensional quantum field theory. The term raviolo refers to the the configuration space of two points in three space (which is topologically a two-sphere) with its transversely holomorphic foliated structure.

  <p>
    We initiate the study of loop corrections to local operators in the holomorphic twist of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theory. Some corrections to indices and local operators of non-perturbative nature are also analyzed in the cases of SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theory.

		A motivic filtration on the topological cyclic 
		homology of commutative ring spectra.</a> June 2022. With
	Jeremy Hahn and Arpon Raksit.
	<br>	
	For a prime number $p$ and a $p$-quasisyntomic commutative ring $R$, 
	Bhatt--Morrow--Scholze defined motivic filtrations on the $p$-completions 
	of $\THH(R), \TC^{-}(R), \TP(R),$ and $\TC(R)$, with the associated graded 
	objects for $\TP(R)$ and $\TC(R)$ recovering the prismatic and syntomic 
	cohomology of $R$, respectively. We give an alternate construction of 
	these filtrations that applies also when $R$ is a well-behaved commutative 
	ring spectrum; for example, we can take $R$ to be $\mathbb{S}$, $\mathrm{MU}$, 
	$\mathrm{ku}$, $\mathrm{ko}$, or $\mathrm{tmf}$.  We compute the 
	mod $(p,v_1)$ syntomic cohomology of the Adams summand $\ell$ and 
	observe that, when $p \ge 3$, the motivic spectral sequence for 
	$V(1)_*\mathrm{TC}(\ell)$ collapses at the $\mathrm{E}_2$-page.

	We define, in C<sub>p</sub>-equivariant homotopy theory for p>2, a notion of µ<sub>p</sub>-orientation analogous to a C<sub>2</sub>-equivariant Real orientation. The definition hinges on a C<sub>p</sub>-space CP<sub>µ<sub>p</sub></sub>, which we prove to be homologically even in a sense generalizing recent C<sub>2</sub>-equivariant work on conjugation spaces.
	We prove that the height p-1 Morava E-theory is µ<sub>p</sub>-oriented and that tmf(2) is µ<sub>3</sub>-oriented. We explain how a single equivariant map S<sup>2&rho;</sup> &#8594; &Sigma;<sup>&#8734;</sup></sub>CP<sub>µ<sub>p</sub></sub> completely generates the homotopy of E<sub>p-1</sub> and tmf(2), expressing a height-shifting phenomenon pervasive in equivariant chromatic homotopy theory.

Real topological Hochschild homology and the Segal conjecture.</a> November 2019.  With
Jeremy Hahn.
<br> <em><strong>Advances in Mathematics.</strong></em><br>
	
	We give a new proof, independent of Lin’s theorem, 
	of the Segal conjecture for the cyclic group of order two. 
	The key input is a calculation, as a Hopf algebroid, of 
	the Real topological Hochschild homology of F_2. 
	This determines the E2-page of the descent spectral sequence for 
	the map from NF_2 to F_2, where NF_2 is the C2-equivariant Hill–Hopkins–Ravenel norm 
	of F_2. 
	The E2-page represents a new upper bound on the RO(C_2)-graded homotopy of NF_2, 
	from which the Segal conjecture is an immediate corollary.

		In this mostly expository note we take advantage
		of homotopical and algebraic advances
		to give a modern
		account of power operations on the mod 2 homology
		of commutative ring spectra. The main
		advance is a quick proof of the Adem

On categories of slices</a>. Nov. 2017.
<br>
In this paper we give an algebraic description
of the category of n-slices for an arbitrary
group G, in the sense of Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel.
Specifically, given a finite group G and an integer n, we construct
an explicit G-spectrum 
W (called an <b>isotropic slice n-sphere</b>)
with the following properties: (i) the n-slice of a G-spectrum X
is equivalent to the data of a certain quotient of the Mackey functor
<u>[W, X]</u> as a module over the endomorphism Green functor
<u>[W,W]</u>; (ii) the category of n-slices is equivalent to the full
subcategory of right modules over <u>[W,W]</u> for which
a certain restriction map is injective. We use this theorem to recover
the known results on categories of slices to date, and exhibit
the utility of our description in several new examples. We go
further and show that the Green
functors <u>[W,W]</u> for
certain slice n-spheres have a special property
(they are <b>geometrically split</b>)
which reduces the amount of data necessary
to specify a <u>[W,W]</u>-module. This step
is purely algebraic and may be of independent interest.

examples of such series for tmf<sub>0</sub>(N) and show that the Ochanine genus comes from an
