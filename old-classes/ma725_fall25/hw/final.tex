\subsection*{Problem 1} 
Let $q$ be a complex number satisfying $0 < q \br q < 1$. 
Define
\begin{equation}\label{}
  X_q = \left(\C^2 \setminus 0 \right) \slash \Z 
\end{equation}
where the $\Z$-action is generated by $(z,w) \mapsto (q z , q w)$.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Show that $X_q$ can be endowed with the structure of a complex manifold with the property that the
    canonical map $\C^2 \setminus 0 \to X_q$ is holomorphic.
  \item[(b)] Show that $X_q \simeq S^3 \times S^1$ as \textit{smooth} manifolds.
  \item[(c)] Does there exist a decomposition 
    \begin{equation}\label{}
      H^k(X_q;\C) = \oplus_{p+q=k} H^{q}(X_q,\Omega^{p,hol})
    \end{equation}
for $k=0,1,2$? Explain why or why not.
\item[(d)] Is $\Omega^\bu(X_\C)$ formal as a commutative dg algebra?
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Let $\Sigma$ be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension two.
\begin{itemize}
  \item[(a)] Define a \textit{conformal structure} on $\Sigma$ 
  \item[(b)] Show that there is a bijective correspondence between conformal structures on $\Sigma$ and complex
    structures on $\Sigma$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problem 3} 
Show that if $G$ is a complex Lie group (meaning, a Lie group and a complex manifold for which the product and inverse
operations are holomorphic) and compact, then $G$ is abelian.

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold and suppose that $\omega,\omega'$ are two K\"ahler forms on $X$ which are
cohomologous $[\omega]=[\omega'] \in H^2(X;\R)$.
Show that there exists a real function $f \in C^\infty(X)$ such that $\omega' = \omega + \im \del \dbar f$.
