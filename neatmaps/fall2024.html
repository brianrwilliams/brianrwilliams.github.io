  <i> Representations of affine quantum groups and equivariant homology of affine Grassmannians
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Let G be a semisimple complex Lie group and N a maximal unipotent subgroup of G. In their study of the equivariant homology of the affine Grassmannian Gr_{G\vee}, Baumann-Kamnitzer-Knutson introduced an algebraic morphism \overline{D} on the coordinate ring \mathbb{C}[N] providing a powerful tool to compare distinguished bases of this algebra, such as the Mirkovic-Vilonen basis arising from the geometric Satake correspondence. In this talk we will focus onthe simply-laced case and present an alternative description of \overline{D} proposed in a joint workwith Jian-Rong Li, that relies on Hernandez-Leclerc’s categorification of the cluster structure of \mathbb{C}[N] via finite-dimensional representations of affine quantum groups. We will then present our second work recently posted on the arxiv (also joint with Jian-Rong Li) where we establish a large family of non-trivial rational identities obtained by applying our construction to Frenkel-Reshetikhin’s q-characters. If time allows, we will discuss possible interpretations of these identities in terms of equivariant homology, raising the question of natural geometric models associated to representations of affine quantum groups.

  <i> Frobenius objects in 2-Span, 2-Segal sets and the symplectic category
</i>
<ul><br><li>
2-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFT) can be classified via (commutative) Frobenius algebras. In this talk, we will describe Frobenius objects in a category where the objects are sets and the morphisms are isomorphism classes of spans, which is a suitable model for the symplectic category. Our key result is that it is possible to construct a simplicial set (with some additional conditions) that encodes the data of the Frobenius structure. The simplicial sets that arise in this way can be characterized by a few relatively nice conditions. As an application (in progress), we recover a Frobenius structure from the reduced, and possibly singular, reduced phase space of the Poisson sigma model. This is based on work with Rajan Mehta and Molly Keller, and Mehta and Walker Stern.

<i> Liouville Theory and Weil-Petersson Geometry </i>

<ul><br><li> Two-dimensional conformal field theory is a powerful tool to understand the geometry of surfaces.  Liouville conformal field theory in the classical (large central charge) limit encodes the geometry of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. I describe an efficient algorithm to compute the Weil--Petersson metric to arbitrary accuracy using Zamolodchikov's recursion relation for conformal blocks, focusing on examples of a sphere with four punctures and generalizations to other one-complex-dimensional moduli spaces. Comparison with analytic results for volumes and geodesic lengths finds excellent agreement.
In the case of M_{0,4}, I discuss numerical results for eigenvalues of the Weil-Petersson Laplacian and connections with random matrix theory.
Based on work with K. Coleville, A. Maloney, K. Namjou, and T. Numasawa.

  <i> A new approach to Virasoro conformal blocks
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Given a Riemann surface C one can define the vector space of Virasoro conformal blocks on C. This vector space is important in conformal field theory (it describes in some sense the "universal part" of the correlation functions) and also of some mathematical interest (related e.g. to tau-functions, instanton moduli spaces, representations of mapping class groups and skein algebras.) I will give an elementary definition of the space of Virasoro blocks, and describe a new scheme for constructing them via "abelianization".

  <i> Ordinary TQFTs Cannot Distinguish Simply Connected 6-Manifolds
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Work by David Reutter and Chris Schommer-Pries has shown that TQFTs can distinguish stable diffeomorphism classes of closed, connected, even-dimensional manifolds subject to certain finiteness conditions. In particular, simply connected closed 6-manifolds with finite \pi_2 are diffeomorphic if and only if they cannot be distinguished by TQFTs, and it was conjectured that this result holds for all closed, simply connected 6-manifolds. We will present a pair of non-diffeomorphic closed, simply connected 6-manifolds with infinite \pi_2 that are indistinguishable by TQFTs, disproving the conjecture.

  <i>  3d Quantum Trace Map </i>
<ul><br><li>
In 2010, Bonahon and Wong constructed the 2d quantum trace map, connecting two different quantizations of the SL_2(C) character variety of an ideally triangulated hyperbolic surface S. The classical limit of this map expresses the trace of the holonomy of a closed immersed curve in S as a Laurent polynomial in the (square roots of the) shear coordinates for the hyperbolic structure defined with respect to the triangulation. In this talk, we will discuss a new construction of a 3d quantum trace map for ideally triangulated 3-manifolds, focusing on the geometric aspects.  This is joint work with Sunghyuk Park.

  <i> The Topology of Configuration Spaces of Circles in the Plane
</i>
<ul><br><li>
We consider the space of all configurations of finitely many (potentially nested) circles in the plane and compute the fundamental group of each of its connected components. These groups can be viewed as “braided” versions of the automorphism groups of finite rooted trees. This is joint work with Justin Curry and Matthew Zaremsky.

  <i> Sectorial Decompositions of Symmetric Products and Homological Mirror Symmetry
</i>
<ul><br><li>
 Symmetric products of Riemann surfaces play a crucial role in symplectic geometry and low-dimensional topology. They are essential ingredients for defining Heegaard Floer homology and serve as important examples of Liouville manifolds when the surfaces are open. In this talk, I will discuss ongoing work on the symplectic topology of these spaces through Liouville sectorial methods, along with an example illustrating the application of this decomposition to homological mirror symmetry.

  <i> Supergeometry of Adinkras and (Quantum) Error Correcting Codes
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Supermultiplets in particle physics, stripped of their spatial dimensions, can be described in terms of a class of N-edge regular bipartite decorated graphs known as Adinkras.  We will start by explaining how to construct all of these from quotients of the 1-skeleton of binary N-dimensional hypercubes by doubly even binary linear error correcting codes.  We then geometrize these graphs, realizing them on Riemann surfaces arising as rigid branched covers of the thrice-punctured sphere.  The additional markings on an Adinkra can then be reinterpreted as providing special spin structures and divisors coming from discrete Morse functions.  Applying Kitaev's surface code construction yields an associated quantum error-correcting code.  The supersymmetric origin and extra markings suggest ingredients for a supersymmetric extension of the surface code as well as a form of mirror symmetry.

  <i> Holomorphic gauge theories and factorization algebras
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Physics has gifted mathematics several beautiful conjectures and examples in the form of topological field theories --- including Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds and mirror symmetry --- which arise by ``twisting'' supersymmetric field theories and their dualities. We will describe another type of ``twist'' that produces holomorphic field theories and examine some of the problems and possibilities suggested by various examples. Given time, we will describe work in progress on a holomorphic form of Seiberg duality for 4-dimensional gauge theories or holomorphic aspects related to Kapustin-Witten theories (and hence the geometric Langlands program).

  <i> Mirror Symmetry for the Affine Toda Systems
</i>
<ul><br><li>
I’ll present recent work on mirror symmetry for the affine Toda systems, which can be viewed as a Betti Geometric Langlands correspondence (after Ben-Zvi—Nadler) in the wild setting. More explicitly, we realize the affine Toda system (associated to a complex semisimple group) as a moduli space of Higgs bundles on P^1 with certain automorphic data, and the dual side is the group version of the universal centralizer (associated to the dual group), which is a wild character variety. We show that the wrapped Fukaya category of the former is equivalent to the category of coherent sheaves of the latter. The proof uses my previous result on the mirror symmetry for the (usual) Toda systems, also known as the universal centralizers. This is joint work with Zhiwei Yun.

  <i> n-Complicial sets as a model for (oo,n)-categories
</i>
<ul><br><li>
The formalism of extended TQFTs relies the notion of an (oo,n)-category: a categorical structure with morphisms in each dimension, which can be composed in a weakly associative way, and which are weakly invertible in dimension higher than n. In this expository talk I will describe the notion of an n-complicial set, explain the intuition for how this implements the idea of an (oo,n)-category, and discuss some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

  <i> Constructing higher categories with desired properties
</i>
<ul><br><li>
In this talk we will sketch the construction of a family of symmetric monoidal $(\infty,3)$-categories which is motivated by the Rozansky-Witten field theories of Kapustin, Rozansky, and Saulina (arXiv:0810.5415, 0909.3643) and the $(\infty,n)$-category of higher Lagrangian correspondences of Calaque, Haugseng, and Scheimbauer (arXiv:2108.02473). The underlying framework has "generalized spans" in some $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and at the top level these spans are equipped with a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category parametrized by $\mathcal{C}$; the objects of the latter compose with a push-pull formula resembling the Fourier-Mukai transform of algebraic geometry. We apply the construction to get an approximation of the Rozansky-Witten 3-category and extend some dualizability results of Brunner, Carqueville, and Roggenkamp (arXiv:2201.03284).

  <i> Nonorientable broken Lefschetz fibrations
</i>
<ul><br><li>
Lefschetz fibrations are a special type of map from a 4-manifold to a surface, usually either S^2 or D^2. Although they provide a lot of information about their source manifold, they’re only admitted by a limited collection of 4-manifolds. This motivates the study of broken Lefschetz fibrations; by relaxing the definition of a Lefschetz fibration, we get a family of maps that all closed, smooth 4-manifolds admit. In this talk, we’ll review the basic topology of broken Lefschetz fibrations, both in the more-established orientable case, and in the more-recent nonorientable case. We’ll examine the data that such a map provides, and see how we can obtain a broken Lefschetz fibration from a more general map onto S^2.

  <i> Intertwiners of representaions of quantum affine algebras and Yangians.
</i>
<ul><br><li>
The trigonometric and rational R-matrices are operators acting in the tensor squares of representations of quantum affine algebras and Yangians respectively. We give explicit expressions of these operators for the first funadamental representations of all (twisted and untwisted) quantum affine algebras and Yangians, in terms of certain projectors and matrix units.

  <i> Picard n-categories as 2-truncated (n+2)-categories
</i>
<ul><br><li>
A Picard n-category is a symmetric monoidal n-category with tensor inverses for cells up to degree n-1. We describe the method of defining a Picard n-category as a 2-truncated (n+2)-category for small dimensions. We then discuss the problem of obtaining a general Picard n-category using this methodology for large enough n.
